# Thunder Flappy - A Flappy Bird Clone

A classic **Flappy Bird** style game built with **Thunde Engine** where players control a bird navigating through obstacles by tapping to keep it airborne.

## Features

*   **Simple One-Button Control:** Press spacebar or click to make the bird flap
*   **Procedural Obstacles:** Randomly generated pipes with varying gap positions
*   **Score Tracking:** Earn points for each pair of pipes successfully passed
*   **Collision Detection:** Precise physics for bird-pipe and ground collisions
*   **Gravity Physics:** Realistic falling and flapping mechanics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Ensure you have the **Thunde Engine** installed and properly set up on your system


## How to Play

1.  **Start Game:** Press spacebar or click to begin
2.  **Control the Bird:** Tap spacebar or click to make the bird flap upward
3.  **Navigate Pipes:** Fly through the gaps between pipes
4.  **Avoid Obstacles:** Don't hit pipes, ground, or ceiling
5.  **Score Points:** Earn one point for each pair of pipes you pass successfully

## Controls

| Action | Control |
| :--- | :--- |
| Flap / Jump | `Left Click` |


## Game Mechanics

*   **Gravity Constant:** Bird naturally falls downward
*   **Flap Power:** Each tap gives an upward velocity boost
*   **Pipe Speed:** Pipes move from right to left at constant speed
*   **Pipe Spacing:** Consistent distance between pipe pairs
*   **Gap Randomization:** Vertical gap position changes for each pipe pair
*   **Collision Boundaries:** Game ends on contact with pipes, ground, or ceiling


## Technology

This project is built as a learning exercise using the **Thunde Engine**, demonstrating 2D game development, physics simulation, collision detection, and procedural content generation.
